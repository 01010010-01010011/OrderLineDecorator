# OrderLineDecorator

Visually displays the following on STOP and TARGET orders:
- Number of contracts
- Currency value of potential P/L 
- Percentage of Account for stops and targets
- Ticks from entry
- Points from entry

## Note:
If you change the default font on your chart, the decorator may render with an overlap. To make adjustments, there is a parameter available in the configuration page. This value defaults to 90 pixels. Increase or decrease as needed for your specific chart.
